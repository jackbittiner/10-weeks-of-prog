# 10 Weeks of Prog

Have you ever been in an interview, or a performance review, where you've been asked a question something similar to this:

```
Name me a time when you....?
```

It's very common, and sometimes it's hard to conjure up a compelling answer on the spot.

Welcome to 10 Weeks of Prog!

We will set a weekly challenge in the format of the question above. It is your task, that week, to do something that could then be used to answer the question. So if the question was: `Name a time you led a workshop`, you need to organise and prepare a workshop for your colleagues.

Feel free to log your answer and share with the 10 Weeks of Prog community to support and inspire each other.

YOU WILL GET THAT PROMOTION!

YOU WILL GET THAT AWESOME JOB YOU WANT!

Good luck!
